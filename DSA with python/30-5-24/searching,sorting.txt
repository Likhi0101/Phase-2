2 types of searching
    1. linear - one by one
    2. binary - data should be sorted
o(1) - const time
o(n) - using only one for loop
     - depend on no.of n
space complexity - const
bubble sort - largest num goes to last for every iteration
insertion sort - pick one by one in unsorted and keep in original position
selection sort - smallest num goes to first
in insertion sort i value will start at 2 position
quick sort - nlogn is better
           - pick one by one and keep in original position 
           - pivot element is 1st element - can be in first,last or middle
